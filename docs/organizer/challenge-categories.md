It is possible to **create categories** within a challenge to make it **easier to organize projects in different themes**. Thus teams will be able to associate one or more categories to their projects. This allows, for example, that in a scenario where a challenge has different prizes by theme/category, projects are filtered by them.

## Create Categories

On your challenge page (CMS), at the bottom, you can find the **categories section**. Here you can see all your categories, create new ones, edit and delete existing categories.

## Delete Categories
